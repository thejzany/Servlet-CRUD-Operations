# Java Servlet CRUD Operations

This repository contains a simple Java Servlet project that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It serves as a basic web application designed to help you understand how to perform these operations using Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages).

## Features

### CRUD Operations

- **Update:** It provides the capability to update existing entities.

- **Delete:** You can delete entities.

### Web Interface

The project offers a straightforward web-based user interface for easy interaction with the application. Users can perform CRUD operations through a web browser, making it accessible and user-friendly.

### Servlets and Hibernate

The project employs Servlets for handling HTTP requests and Hibernate to manage data stored in a relational database. This combination of technologies ensures efficient and secure communication between the web application and the database.
